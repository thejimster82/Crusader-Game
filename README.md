# Crusader-Game
The idea behind this project was to get together with 3 friends on a weekend and make as good of a game as we were able to do. It turned
out that the Ludum Dare Jam actually required teams of two, so we split up and made totally separate projects while working in the same
room (the same kitchen table). The goal of our game was to make some sort of endless runner with randomly generated things thrown in
for fun, this ended up happening in a way but, as with many one or two day projects, most of the features were not fully implemented.
My friend Collin and I somehow came up with the idea that it was going to be a crusade-themed game and it sort of took off from there.

At this point we had minimal experience with coding in general so most of our ideas were funneled through youtube tutorials. For instance,
the idea to make a set of platforms that cycled through being enabled and disabled when they went off and on screen was totally taken
from the youtuber gameplusjames. I've used that idea to save memory in other games and just as a mental device for saving materials in
games in general so I have to thank him for that. I ended up working on the platforming while Collin worked on attacking enemies by
throwing a spear but, sadly, the spear-throwing didn't quite make it into the game because we had a hard time actually combining our 
unity projects. Either way, the final game is an endless runner with a mix of original and copyright-free art, a cycling background,
a camera effect, and a point counter which was about as much as we could to at the time and with the time. It was an extremely fun
process and I hope that comes through in the silly nature of the presentation.
